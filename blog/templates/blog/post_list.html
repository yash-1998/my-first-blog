            <p>Universe 7 (第7宇宙 Dai nana Uchū),Our Universe,is the seventh of twelve universes in the Dragon Ball series, it includes planets, stars, a large amount of galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. Universe 7 was linked with Universe 6, creating a twin universe. This universe is where the entirety of the Dragon Ball series takes place, except for the Universe 6 Saga in Dragon Ball Super, when Goku and the others go to a neutral area between Universe 7 and Universe 6, the "Future" Trunks Saga taking place between Universe 7 and Universe 10, and the Universe Survival Saga taking place in the World of Void for the Tournament of Power between eight of the twelve universes. Universe 7 also ranks as second to bottom on the mortal-levels scale as a 3.18 according to Zeno and Future Zeno. </p>

            <h2><a href="">Universe 6</a></h2>

            <p>Universe 6 (第6宇宙 Dai roku Uchū), the Challenging Universe , was the sixth of the twelve universes in the Dragon Ball series, it includes planets, stars, a large amount of galaxies. Universe 6 is linked with Universe 7, creating a twin universe. Being a twin universe, almost identical to Universe 7, any planets that have existed and/or exist in Universe 7 will also likely have existed or exist in Universe 6. The majority of planets are unknown, but it is known that Universe 6 has an Earth, but it had been ravaged by war with the Earthlings on that Earth, which rendered the Earthlings extinct, until Beerus revived the planet, and all of its inhabitants, with the Super Dragon Balls. Planet Sadala, which was destroyed in Universe 7, still exists in Universe 6. It is the universe with the tenth lowest mortal level.[1] Universe 6 was eventually erased during the Tournament of Power, at the same time as Universe 2, when the last members of Team Universe 6, Pirina and Saonel, were knocked off the ring by Gohan and Piccolo.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Universe 11</a></h2>
            <p>published: 14.06.2014, 12:14</p>
            <p>Universe 11 (第11宇宙 Dai jūichi Uchū), the Justice Universe, is the eleventh of the twelve universes in the Dragon Ball series, it includes planets, stars, and a large amount of galaxies. Universe 11 was linked with Universe 2, creating a twin universe. It is the universe with the fifth highest mortal level.

Noticeably, the two gods appear to be on very good terms with each other, working well together, as Toppo takes orders from both of them without question and apparently without disagreement from either side.

Also, Marcarita, the Angel of Universe 11, seems to take a more proactive role in advising the gods whom she serves than others of her kind in the other universes. </p>
